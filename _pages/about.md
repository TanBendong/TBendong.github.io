Hi! I’m Stuart, a staff ethnographer and principal investigator at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu) at UC-Berkeley. I’m an interpretive social scientist by training with a background in the humanities, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. I empirically study how we know what we know, using qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate the socio-technical systems that support the production of knowledge. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites.
